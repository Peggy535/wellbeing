# Heading

The web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about your Progressive Web App and how it should behave when installed on the user's desktop or mobile device. A typical manifest file includes the app name, the icons the app should use, and the URL that should be opened when the app is launched.

Manifest files are [supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#Browser_compatibility) in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, UC Browser, Opera, and the Samsung browser. Safari has partial support.

## Create the manifest.webmanifest file [\#](https://web.dev/add-manifest/#create)

The manifest file can have any name, but is commonly named `manifest.webmanifest` and served from the root (your website's top-level directory).
