**Embrace all of you - including the BS!**



All of your mistakes/lessons all of your almosts but no cigar moments! All of what others would see as your failures and you know those failures have just been a testing ground for the best that’s yet to come. Embrace it! Change can sometimes be uncomfortable but it’s necessary. Sometimes you don’t know if something is going to work unless you give it ago. But please embrace what hasn’t worked and be kind to yourself if it hasn’t gone to plan. Life is a journey and it amazes me still and that’s the ups and downs. 



I have tried and tumbled a fair amount of times but more importantly I’ve been creative and had fun following the ideas. Fears and self doubt would come in waves within the gaps of the highs and the positive stints and that internal compass when you have been on track and aligned to what feels good for you and any particular time or cycle in your life for me anyway has felt right and aligned at the time. My so called failures are still things I am proud of either for trying int he first place or for overcoming and transforming into another stage in life. 



I personally think the older I got the more my self doubt picked up and started to piss about with me until I turned around and looked at it and owned up to my own bullshit. It's an ongoing process but one I can be comfortable in now and have a sense of humour with.



Everyone has BS they need to bin but it just lays around waiting to be picked up and chucked away… Dotted around in your life like the dog shit you see that those lazy dog owners don’t pick up after themselves, if only we all picked up our own dog mess so to speak then no one else would be left to deal with it and bin it… So my point is, own your shit look at it and deal with it before you take it into your next relationship/ friendship/job/ new project or even project your own shit on other innocent bystanders. 



So let’s start cleaning up and bagging our own shit, take ownership, embrace the not so good and love yourself for it, the imperfections that probably aren’t even imperfections just rubbish/ crap you have come to belief due to some nonsense you have picked up that wasn’t even yours to deal with in the first place.



I had 3 or 4 different business ideas before my currant business, I still haven’t owned my shit on pushing myself on finishing my other projects to support my website. I do know I will get there though and I have become more confident in knowing when I need to be patient with myself and when I need to have a word and keep myself accountable to finish projects. 



I want you to use my personal quote from one of my old online projects form past years, beautiful you, which I took down during my time in a narcissist relationship, I was so pissed off about that but I took that mistake and built a better future and business with where I am now. 



“You are beautiful, unique and deserving of all the good things” Justine Hodgson



Don’t ever forget it, warts and all!!! Be authentic, be true, those who can’t handle your vulnerability and truth do not deserve a chair around your table. Choose wisely who comes with you in life and drop them like flies if they bring your vibe down, don’t be afraid to cut cords that you just don’t feel a connection with. People who have kindness and a desire to do good and look for ways to live their best lives and encourage those around them, that’s what I’m looking to attract. Love comes in all disguises, don’t be afraid to love and match the love needed for each friendship you have. It’s good to love, don’t be afraid to give love and receive love, the new way forward is to admit that you are an all loving being and that your acceptance of all of you in turn allows you to understand and accept others who are on the same journey at this moment in time in this life time and on this planet right now. Go back for people if you had to leave them behind for a while and go back when you are ready to offer their chair back to them (time out is all it takes sometimes for friendships to align again at the right time) to join you once more at your table of wise and beautiful souls. Be patient, be kind and embrace all that you are and stop convincing yourself otherwise. Life is beautiful it all depends on how you are looking at it. EMBRACE!



REWORD AND SET THE FOCUS BETTER…
