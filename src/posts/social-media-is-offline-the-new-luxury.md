Social media has started to cause stress and negative emotions. This is not healthy and definitely something that‚Äôs having a negative affect. Do any of these emotions come up for you when you scroll?

Anxiety
Low self esteem
Increased feelings of depression
Poor body image
Loneliness

Of course, It can be a good plat form provided you limit your time and understand why you drop in on any particular app at any time. Think about what, why and who you follow, if it inspires you and makes you feel great then fantastic if it‚Äôs more on the negative side then step back and re evaluate how you spend your time. THOUGHTS become things!
