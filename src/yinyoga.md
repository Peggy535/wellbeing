    para1: 'That instant stress relief button. Research shows that as you get older, if you don’t take quality time to stretch, the body will been to atrophy, stiffen and deteriorate. This program is like the fountain of youth keeping your fascia pliable and hydrated, and therefore restoring youthfulness to your body.'
    para2: 'If you suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, anxiety and stress and IBS Yin is accessible for you! It’s also essential for athletes, acting as a complimentary practice between other hard core yoga and training sessions. Along with Restorative, Yin is the most accessible of the physical yoga systems, in that it can be practised by anyone, regardless of age or ability. It doesn’t even require a mat, a carpet or blanket will do just fine. In Yin, you hold deep, floor-based postures in stillness for between three to five minutes. Using very little muscular effort, each student is encouraged to find their own individual ‘edge’ – the point of stress, but before pain – to the posture, as it is here at this precipice that we enable our bodies to begin to safely open.'
    para3: 'That calm you feel after a yin class is very real. Studies have found yin yoga to have a significant impact on lowering stress and anxiety and reducing the risk of depression. Plus, it activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body and slows your heart rate. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It triggers the fight or flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. Understanding the stress response for my clients is important for me. My clients first sessions are always focused on bringing forward the parasympathetic nervous system, that’s under hypnosis or during a Yin Yoga class.'
    para4: 'The main reason WHY I favour Yin is because it was Yin Yoga that I turned to during my own on going experience as a #longcovid patient. The fight or flight response in the body seems to play a never ending erratic cycle of ups and downs even when there is no real threat. Yin is my medicine, it plays its part in the calming down of the heart rate and opening up the bodies ability to heal. I personally found my breathing ease with the slow practice and my mind and body allowed myself to accept the present moment and just stop fighting against the unknown of the aftermath of the Covid-19 virus.'
    para5: 'If you think Yin Yoga can help you or someone you know, just go ahead and contact me.'
