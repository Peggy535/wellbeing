**Embrace all of you without shame or embarrassment - including the BS!** 

By 'BS' I clearly mean bullshit, thinking you're a failure, embarrassed because you made mistakes, or you are not where you thought you would/should be at a certain stage in your life. Being mean to yourself with negative thoughts of being unworthy of all the good stuff this life has to offer - 'BS'.

I truly mean this, embrace all of your mistakes or lessons, all of your almost but no cigar moments! The whole wonderful and messy lot. Own it and get rid of the shame or embarrassment connected with it. 

Own what others would see as your failures. You know these failures have just been a testing ground for better ways of doing things, embrace them, change can sometimes be uncomfortable but it’s necessary. Sometimes you don’t know if something is going to work unless you give it ago. But please embrace what hasn’t worked and be kind to yourself if it hasn’t gone to plan. Life is a journey, it amazes me still, either by whooping my arse back on track when I have taken a detour or by showing me beautiful abundance when I least expect it.

I can tell you that I have tried and stumbled, even fallen from great heights a fair amount of times, but most importantly I’ve been creative and had fun following the ideas or decisions  before my decent. I have grown and I have learnt from everything, for better and for worse.

My so called failures are still things I am proud of, proud for trying in the first place and for overcoming and transforming into another stage in life by facing my fears.

My take on 'BS' is this, everyone has 'BS' they need to bin, but it just lays around waiting to be picked up and chucked away by those who avoid the truth.  'BS' dotted around in your life like the dog shit you see lazy dog owners not picking up after themselves. If only we all picked up our own dog mess, 'so to speak', then no one else would be left to deal with it. So my point is, own your shit and deal with it, then bin it and move on. That way you don't take it into your next relationship, friendship or job. 

So let’s start cleaning up and bagging our own shit, take ownership, embrace the not so good and love yourself for it, the imperfections that probably aren’t even imperfections just rubbish you have come to believe due to some nonsense you have picked up that probably wasn’t even yours to deal with in the first place.

I have a  personal quote from one of my old online projects from past years, 'Beautiful You".I took the website down during my time in a narcissist relationship, I was so annoyed about that mistake but I took that mistake and built a better future and business idea. Out of trauma I grew something new and even more authentic.

**“You are beautiful, unique and deserving of all the good things” Justine Hodgson**

Don’t ever forget this quote, be authentic, be true, those who can’t handle your vulnerability and truth do not deserve a chair around your table. Choose wisely who comes with you in life.

People who have kindness and a desire to do good and look for ways to live their best lives and encourage those around them, that’s what I’m looking to attract. What about you? Think about that one carefully. 

Let's also address briefly 'BS' ideas about love. Love comes in all disguises, don’t be afraid to love and match the love needed for each unique friendship or relationship you have. It’s good to love, don’t be afraid to give love and receive love. The new way forward is to admit that you are an all loving being and that your acceptance of all of you in turn, allows you to understand and accept others who are on the same journey at this moment in time, in this life time and on this planet right now with you. 

It's 'BS' to believe that some people are emotionally unavailable, or unloveable. It's all just excuses to guard against fear of rejection and getting hurt. 

Go back for people if you have had to leave them behind for a while and go back when you are ready to offer their chair back to them (time out is all it takes sometimes for friendships to align again at the right time) to join you once more at your table of wise and beautiful souls. Gather those who can walk forwards with less baggage because they have learnt to deal with their own BS.

Be patient, be kind and embrace all that you are and stop convincing yourself otherwise. Life is beautiful it all depends on how you are looking at it. EMBRACE ALL OF YOU, pick up your own BS, don't project your BS on others and most importantly clear it up so no one else has to do it for you. There is no shame or embarrassment in getting things wrong, not owning up to it, to yourself WILL hold you back though.

With huge love.

Until my next blog.
