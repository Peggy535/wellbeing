The most beneficial thing you can do for yourself as we all move closer towards 2020,  is to get real and cut the Bullshit. The bullshit you feed yourself and others. Have acceptance that the not so good day’s don’t last forever but they are ‘real’ so don’t add any shame or guilt when your day isn’t the most positive. With out the downs there are no ups. Without the Darkness there is no light. You get my drift?

It’s ok to not be ok as long as you understand that what ever is going on on the darker shades of grey days that - THIS TOO SHALL ALWAYS PAST.

So if you are being guided to ask for support or help with something, follow that and heal it. If you are being guided to look at behaviours that have not been serving you or you are done with the old way of doing things, then look closer at that and figure out what action needs to be taken next. What ever you do now is the time for it, as long as you move closer to what really better serves you and those around you. If you are reading this you will know what I mean and you will instantly know that what ever first thought comes to you, it’s that that requires attention, even if you think it’s the hardest thing to look at or move into acceptance of. 

There have been some big shifts in this world this year and momentum is building, so embrace the overwhelming emotions you don’t understand but what ever 
you do don’t ignore them. If you have been feeling more out of sorts or more emotional or anxious over the past few months, then this is mostly down to 
the shifts in energy and more of shift in vibrational energy that you are just not used to feeling in this lifetime. Seek out a guide if everything is getting too much. You don’t need to be alone in anything you don’t understand. So seek help if it’s needed. 

The time is upon us to be as honest with ourselves as we can possibly be, if it’s uncomfortable for a short time then so be it. This world has been travelling for so long in one direction that a helping hand is being sent to lead us out of the shadows and into a new way. However, first things must be cleared, and chess pieces moved and placed correctly on the board of life. Everyone will need to be in their stations and  have already done the necessary work called them to do, in order for the universe to do what’s very much needed as we move into 2020. 

There have been until late so many spiritual bankrupt human beings running around with fame and fortune at the forefront of their mind, and although helping others, they have without knowing it become junkies to another new kind of programming. This is now being felt and many are questioning every area of their lives during this last period of 2019. Permanent change  is now required from us all. A new way, a new wave of spiritual understanding and acceptance is very much amongst us and gains strength and momentum day by day. 

If you have been experiencing an urgency to either RUN from your current life of drama or a Strong DESIRE to STOP and RETREAT because you need to go within and repare for something you don’t quite understand, or even know what it is, but you know it’s an undercurrent of something bigger than what your current programming will have you believe, then take note and listen to yourself, look around you and really assess because going into 2020 you will be called upon to do the work you are here to do. 

This undercurrent in the universe is real and one that is clearing the BS and briniging out the honesty and truth from everything and everyone, this temporarily can feel like chaos but it’s a calling and the biggest of it’s kind to come to us all in the longest of times. 

LET’s look at this little fragment of BS that we can all refer to. 

"You read the blogs, scroll the social media pages. Judge not just others but also yourself and where you fit in, in the pecking order of life!"


As you scroll does it cross your mind whether you are a winner or a loser? Are you good or bad? Are you good enough or falling short of being enough? 

Are you pretty? Handsome? Popular? Rich? 

Do you inspire or are you too much? 

Do people use you? Do you use people? Do you own your POWER or do you give your POWER away easily without knowing it. 

Constant daily comparison!!!!

If social media were to stop dead tomorrow what would you fill your time with, and what did you actually, honestly feel as you read those last few words?? 

As a new and small business owner, I could be pressured in to being on all the platforms and watch the Instagram Algorithms. Honestly, it’s time consuming 
and pre programmed ‘BULLSHIT’ another way to become a sheep and follow everyone else for success!

I understand the platform uses and value but I also understand that there is way too much sway the other way… away from authenticity and following your own flow. It also takes people away from nature and all the beautiful gifts of this amazing world to see away from the screen.

Truthfully I can’t be anything else but me, and I will be me, I don’t just post because an algorithm is dictating that it’s the best time to post or I need to post regularly, that I have to be this or that to push my business and to become this programmed little lamb going to the slaughter and killing my own authenticity!

I’ve tried it and dislike it with every cell in my body. So I say, ‘NO’, no to conforming to what everyone in the business world thinks I should be doing for my little business on my social media platforms. I believe that those who need me will come across my path and I will help those who resinate with who and what I am and my honesty. My HONESTY in wanting to genuinely heal and help, to ensure quality and not quantity is the key factor here at the very core of my work. 

My Honesty and Truth on this 'BS'

If I want to post I will, if I don’t get any likes well hell, I am sure I will live to see another day!!! Somedays you win a lot somedays you win a little less. 

How can anyone judge their success on social media platforms. I’m a very successful hypnotherapist in the fact that I work closely with my clients and everyone of them has had 100% success in a short period of time. Success is seeing their smile and reading their messages to me on their life’s journey after freeing themselves from what ever was holding them back or getting in their way. 

My own personal expectation of my little beautiful business is slow and steady and I encourage myself daily to stay grounded while I do the ground work for my little business to thrive and grow as it is supposed to. I got caught up and spent a lot of time buying into watching the entrepreneur videos, jumping on the podcasts and being the student. I thought I just needed to catchup and learn to be more like this new generation but you know what. No, No, No and No again… 

On the day’s I really feel like I have something to say that may help someone, I will do it!

"On the day’s I feel a quote may help someone, then I’m going to add it to my story!"

On the day’s when my ‘kickass’ little business has something exciting to share, then I”m gonna share it!

When I want to let loved ones still feel connected to me from different parts of the country or world, then I’m gonna think of them and give them a glimpse of what’s going on. This is the one thing I like about these platforms.

But I “WILL NOT” conform to this 'BS' of what is expected.

What I DO IS:  I live my life mainly off the platforms, I do life! I spend about 10% on social media. For me this is my truth and my honesty on this one subject. I follow people who inspire me and I celebrate them 100%.

If this blog helps someone else because this resonates with them then fabulous, if no one agrees with my words then that’s fabulous too.

I leave you with a beautiful healthy mindset and a full heart as I continue my own journey, my own journey to being a little less full of my own BS on this subject. I hope this has turned on a light bulb in your own mind today somehow.

You get to be and do you! I get to be and do ME. Love or hate these platforms, they are here but let’s Just be as honest and truthful about the information we are giving and the energy we are sending out into this fantastic universe via these platforms.

Ride the wave of energy that surrounds you with your truth!

Much Love
