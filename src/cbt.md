    title1: 'CBT - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy'
    para1: 'CBT is a therapy that focuses on the particular ways in which an individual thinks, behaves and acts, in the attempt to deal successfully with their behavioural, emotional and social problems and issues.'
    para2: 'The difference between psychotherapy and behavioural therapy is that psychotherapy tends to emphasise the importance of the personal meaning placed upon things and how the majority of thinking patterns begin in childhood. Behavioural therapy relates to everything the person does. How they act with other people, when they are alone. How they avoid certain aspects of life and how they engage and interact with the world around them. How active or inactive towards being involved in participating in life on a healthy level.'
    para3: 'The great advantage that ‘CBT’ has over other therapies is that clients undergoing ‘CBT’ treatment are actually learning the educational aspects of the therapy, which is then empowering them to become their own personal therapist and to be more aware of the circumstances, situations, behaviours and people the could cause them to lapse and therefore to be able to avoid these aspects in their lives.'
    para4: 'I bring together a  combination of CBT and Curative Hypnosis to assist a number of my clients and we have experienced amazing results. Especially in stress related disorders.'
    para5: 'If you think CBT can help you or someone you know, just go ahead and contact me.'
