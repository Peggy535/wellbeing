As we move into another potential lock down. My thoughts and prayers go to all those living with narcissistic partners. I know how unrealistic it is to seek help if your phone and other devices have been tapped or just monitored. An opportunity will show up and even though you may have to walk away with nothing you walk away with everything. You, your sanity and your freedom to find yourself again  and start rebuilding literally from the ground up.\

I found this article I wrote almost 3 years ago as part of a campaign for narcissist support group. It's taken me this long to share it as a blog and now I pray a potential sign of hope to anyone reading this. Although life still throws its punches and I take the good with the bad, my soul, my personal power, my life is lived without manipulation, games or lies. Anyone who has survived this kind of betrayal and dance with the dark side will know, you wish you had ran at first sight. The only way out is to get out, go 'NO Contact' and never look back! I found  Hypnotherapy and out of the shadows of all I had been through, I found my new path and new career as a Hypnotherapist and Wellbeing Specialist. \

Enjoy the article. With love, hope and faith.
