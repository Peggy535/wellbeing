From a personal view point and that of my clients, setting goals and combining self hypnosis, has more than often achieved more in a matter of weeks than it is possible in a couple of years. 
               
I personally have within this last year alone and, we are only in September, achieved so very much more than I had hoped to have achieved. I had originally set myself two years to achieve the life I find myself living currently and there is so very much more happening before this year is up too.

Itâ€™s been exciting times and so much Joy that I experience since moving into hypnotherapy, A complete 360 turn around from last year! 
               
Self hypnosis once shown how to practise it, can have a huge impact on your life! 

Hypnosis isnâ€™t just for treatment of trauma, phobias, depression, anxiety, addiction, weight lose. Itâ€™s so much more and can be used daily if you know what you are doing. All the positives of creating your own reality, own life to the fullest is at your finger tips, it just takes effort and good intent and a passion for experiencing the joy of everything along your daily journey or at least understanding the journey and finding joy in the fact you are learning more about yourself and your own desires from within/source/YOU.

Self hypnosis is a wonderful way of helping you to achieve your goal or goals because it enables you to get your subconscious on board and sync with 
your conscious goals.
