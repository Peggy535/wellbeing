**Use the different brain waves to explain which one meditation falls into and how closely it is to self hypnosis. (Use the secrets of meditation book to reference and base from) including the below in a better written format.**





Have you been wondering if you should jump on the trend of mindfulness and the whole Meditation vibe?!



You will be surprised by the amount of people who have been meditating for years, they may just not have been shouting about it. It’s not such a new thing, in fact it’s been around for an eternity! Every where you look at the moment so many are looking into mindfulness and looking into finding more balance and freedom from the constant thoughts and to do lists in our minds. Yoga and Meditation seem to be the done thing. All it really boils down to is movement of body to release negative energy and finding stillness of mind after releasing the energy that got stale. We are energy and the more we flow with our own energy and follow our intuition our minds seem less troubled. There is high and low energy and you can control this yourself. You just need to learn how it works and the benefits of taking responsibility to learn about yourself and what helps you live a more authentic life according to your internal compass. If you put the effort in to explore and stay in your own lane with it, keep it a personal thing and learn to feel your way out of any negative energy through body movement, releasing stale and old energy and generating new more beneficial energy on a daily basis. Learn who you are, learn to be more you and come to the world with more for the greater good.



Benefits?

Is it all just rubbish?

Science backs it up?









Find a teacher who can talk you through the basics and get some sound knowledge and insight. It’s very much a personal and intuitive practice. There ins’t any need for the perfect meditation cushion or anything elaborate. Physical comfort is key to being able to find the stillness in the mind. But avoid thinking you have to spend money on material comforts. Use what you already have at hand. If you are not comfortable sitting crossed legged on the floor simply just sit in a chair. Less is More in the case of Meditation.



So how to start:



Sit in your designated quiet space with your preference of floor or chair. (Even if you are bed bound, you still have your mind and you can do this from your bed too)!
