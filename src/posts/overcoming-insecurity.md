Dealing with Insecurity (Image on my desktop and audio in Hypnosis folder) Next Blog 





Once you embrace your value, talents, and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you.” – Rob Liano.



On a personal level my father left when I was very little, I was so busy being in love with life with my tap dancing shoes and ballet to be precise that when this big fight broke out and it resulted in my father never returning home, I seemed stunned when my world spun around on me and nothing was the same again. Out off my little innocent girl daily dancing and being very confident and happy to a little girl who wondered what just happened and when will I see my Daddy again. It wasn’t until my adult years that old deep childhood wounds would start to come to the service in my choice of relationships. (Reword) Now is not the time to delve any deeper in my own story and journey. Let's leave that for another time.



The purpose to this blog is simply to give anyone reading this a heads up on what to recognise and what steps you can take to ease your way forwarding life if you have been struggling with why you keep hitting brick walls in areas of your life due to a sticky little insecurity that is most definitely holding you back from something, and from living the life you know you are screaming in life to claim and get on with. So let’s try to get rid of this hold up and give yourself time on this and watch the positive shifts that happen.
