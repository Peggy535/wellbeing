***It is our radiance, our flow, our grace, our intuition, our compassion, and our love that create the magnificence of who we are.*** 

When our Prana moves freely through our physical body, we become alive with a compelling charm and a magnetism that attracts more positive energy. An exquisite series of physiological and emotional events takes place within our bodies, which we call the health response. Our bodies are electric, and just as electricity lines can have faulty circuits, our Prana can lose its intensity. However, when the electricity of our physiology is flowing optimally, our Prana radiates the most miraculous powers within our very own body. This is the purest form of vitality that is available to all. 



It is our Prana that enhances our physicality, making us healthy and radiant. Our thoughts, prayers, and attitude creates an interaction of wave forms in our body that has a profound effect on us. Our well-being, our sense of happiness, our feelings of being loved, and our ability to give and receive love all depend on the activation of our Prana. the most important attributes we have as human beings are actually the most subtle. It is our radiance, our flow, our grace, our intuition, our compassion, and our love that create the magnificence of who we are. 

***The sensory system that will develop automatically out of us will be our archangel protecting us and glorifying us - Yogi Bhajan***

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that hold our entire sensory system in balance. The SNS awakens, and the PNS soothes. One is like a roller coaster; the other is like a chaise lounge. Humans have a profound ability to use opposites, but this ability works only when our nervous system is regulated and balanced. Ever notice that if you push too hard, things don't work out? Or if you offer no resistance when you know it needs to be applied, you are not able to get beyond a block? Physiologically these experiences are determined by the balance between the two nervous systems. 

The PNS act like a breath of fresh air. It's signals tell our body to relax, loosen up, enjoy the moment, sprawl out, get comfortable, smell the roses, and breath deeply. Our heart rate slows down, blood pressure lowers, our skin glows, we lose weight, our digestion improves, our cells begin to repair themselves, and our mood is happy. We can enjoy the people and things around us. 

Yoga and meditation are some of the very best ways to stimulate the PNS so that it balances the SNA, these techniques can help us use the two opposing systems to hold our consciousness in harmony. Thank god for these practices in the high stress world that we live in. 

YOGA BALANCES THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 

Yin Yoga and Kundalini are more gentle and some would say more spiritual aware practices. Both will help get you set up on your journey with yoga if you are not sure where to start. Yin has been a saving grace to me during my own on going recovery with #longcovid syndrome. Yin and kundalini are both very therapeutic prescribed in the right way, especially for chronic fatigue or chronic illness that requires the use of PACE on a daily basis. The same applies to stress and anxiety, as explained above, it works closely with calming and soothing the body while unblocking any stale energy that needs moving around and bringing the two systems into balance.  So a huge stress relief for anyone who requires a little TLC that they can learn to access at anytime and anywhere once they have the basic tools. 

The mind and body work in sync so a practice in both yoga or any physical movement and self hypnosis, which is a heightened form of meditation, we just access a different higher level of brain wave in hypnosis than you do in Meditation. Both very effective and both necessary to a healthy mental wellness programme. Incorporating both the physical body and mind is a win win situation for anyones daily wellness routine. 

So a thought from me to you if you are sitting on the fence about getting started with any form of physical movement not just Yoga.  

***Do the thing you are afraid to do, and the death of fear is certain. If you say to yourself with perfect confidence and faith, "I am going to master this fear", you will.*** 

Until next time.
