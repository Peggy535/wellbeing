This is why I love hypnotherapy so much, it actually ends up teaching my clients exactly what they are made of. How much they have to offer once they open up to the possibilities of looking inside themselves for the answers they seek and the changes they crave. 

We all have it, a subconscious yet very few of us access it or even know it’s possible. So many social media platforms are discussing how to access the subconscious mind to change behaviour patterns or old belief systems, to name just a few ‘changes’ that society is leading us to move towards. 

There’s a trend that’s been forming for a while but in the background some amazing professionals have been playing around with the subconscious for decades and our ancestors before them. It’s not a new concept at all. 

So whats the big deal and why have I decided to through the word magick and intuition in the mix of this title, well because we all have those too… It’s not hocus pocus although it can be if you want to take your gifts further, what ever tickles your fancy. 

Everyone looks out side themselves for a miracle and magick while the whole time you have every single starting point of accessing your answers from a few layers beneath the surface ‘inside you’. If you can learn how very special these tools are in the aid of understanding yourself better and what is best for you and not for anyone else. I don’t say that from a selfish point of view, I say it from a point of view that if you can stop worrying about what everyone else expects of you or what the belief is that you think society has put on your shoulders to continue to carry like so many before you have and with out much change. 

Basically you are the Magick.. because you have intuition, you may just not have been listening to it and you have a subconscious/ superconscious. These are facts.. 

So let’s look at theses facts on those two subjects alone first

What is Intuition 

Write a bit here out of psychic ability course coaching etc… 

What is Subconscious and superconscious - write out of past lives and currant lives and other resources I’m drawn to here. 

Then if you put these together and learn how to access them as I do through hypnotherapy for all sorts of problem solving for my clients and myself and for finding solutions or new patterns of behaviour 

Then you find your internal Magick and it’s all you and no one else, no one else journey, story or Magick. 

So what’s it going to be, if you could start with one behaviour or simply want to learn how to deal with what ever may be challenging you at the moment. Look at it and decide, are you going to look at it and do something about it or are you going to pretend that you or it does’t matter and walk on by copying the same old story that many many have repeated before you. Stressed out and anxious about never getting much further in life before a repeat of the same old cycle rears it’s ugly head once more. 

Open up your magick tool kit, look inside and then if you need to know how to use these gifts these tools, grab yourself a guide until you can nail it on your own. 

Open them up and let go of all the old beliefs. Magick is real, Magick is you!!!
