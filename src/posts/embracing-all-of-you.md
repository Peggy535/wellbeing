**Embrace all of you - including the BS!** 

By (BS) I mean Bullshit, thinking you're a failure, embarrassed because you made mistakes, or you are not where you thought you would/should be at a certain stage in your life. Being mean to yourself with negative thoughts of someone who is unworthy of all the good stuff this life has to offer - BS!

I truly mean this, embrace all of your mistakes or lessons as I like to think of them, all of your almost but no cigar moments! The whole wonderful and messy lot. Own it and get rid of shame or embarrassment you connect with it because that's not going to serve you well moving forwards.

Own what others would see as your failures. It's not about others and outside of yourself, it's about you. You know those failures have just been a testing ground for better ways of doing things. Embrace them, change can sometimes be uncomfortable but it’s necessary. Sometimes you don’t know if something is going to work unless you give it ago. But please embrace what hasn’t worked and be kind to yourself if it hasn’t gone to plan. Life is a journey, it amazes me still, either by whooping my arse back on track when I have taken a detour away from my path or for the times it gives to me in abundance when I least expect it to.

I can tell you that I have tried and stumbled, even fallen from great heights a fair amount of times, but most importantly I’ve been creative and had fun following the ideas or decisions  before my decent. I have grown and I have learned from everything for the better each time.

I've had fears and doubts, along with the fears and doubts I have also experienced all the hugely positive stints, that all knowing connection with my internal compass when I have been on track and aligned to what felt good and worked.  

My so called failures are still things I am proud of proud for trying in the first place and for overcoming and transforming into another stage in life and facing my fears. I would rather do something rather than remain the same and never know what may have been if I had just tried.

I personally think the older I get the more my self doubt ramps up, starts to mess about with me until I turn around and looked at it and own up to my own bullshit. It's an ongoing process but one I can be comfortable in now and have a sense of humour with.

My take on BS is this, everyone has 'BS' they need to bin but it just lays around waiting to be picked up and chucked away.  Dotted around in your life like the dog shit you see those lazy dog owners not picking up after themselves and doing the responsible thing, if only we all picked up our own dog mess so to speak then no one else would be left to deal with it. So my point is, own your shit look at it and deal with it, then bin it. That way you don't take it into your next relationship, friendship or job. 

So let’s start cleaning up and bagging our own shit, take ownership, embrace the not so good and love yourself for it, the imperfections that probably aren’t even imperfections just rubbish you have come to belief due to some nonsense you have picked up that probably wasn’t even yours to deal with in the first place but you picked it up from someone else.

I have a  personal quote from one of my old online projects from past years, 'Beautiful You" which I took down during my time in a narcissist relationship, I was so pissed off about that mistake but I took that mistake and built a better future and business idea. Out of trauma I grew something new and more authentic to me.

**“You are beautiful, unique and deserving of all the good things” Justine Hodgson**

Don’t ever forget this quote, be authentic, be true, those who can’t handle your vulnerability and truth do not deserve a chair around your table. Choose wisely who comes with you in life and drop them like flies if they are not able to accept all of you, warts and all.

People who have kindness and a desire to do good and look for ways to live their best lives and encourage those around them, that’s what I’m looking to attract. What about you? Think about that one carefully. 

I had some BS ideas about love but this is my take on it today. Love comes in all disguises, don’t be afraid to love and match the love needed for each friendship or relationship you have. It’s good to love, don’t be afraid to give love and receive love, the new way forward is to admit that you are an all loving being and that your acceptance of all of you in turn, allows you to understand and accept others who are on the same journey at this moment in time, in this life time and on this planet right now with you.

Here's a thought, how about we even go back for people if you have had to leave them behind for a while and go back when you are ready to offer their chair back to them (time out is all it takes sometimes for friendships to align again at the right time) to join you once more at your table of wise and beautiful souls, those who can walk forwards with less baggage, BS!

Be patient, be kind and embrace all that you are and stop convincing yourself otherwise. Life is beautiful it all depends on how you are looking at it. EMBRACE ALL OF YOU, pick up your own BS, don't project your BS on others and most importantly clear it up so no one else has to do it for you. There is no shame or embarrassment in getting things wrong, not owning up to it to yourself will hold you back though.



Until my next blog.



Huge love.
